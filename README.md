Scraper code for TFL website

TODO
----

1. Refactor scraping
1. Add more scraping feeds
1. Find a safe way to store xml. DONT DELETE EVER!
1. xml is HUGE uncompressed but has a lot of redundant data and can be compressed to very small...maybe S3 buckets?
1. Flatten XML and derive some useful data structures. Maybe 30 second snaps of every train??
1. Find a safe way to store flattened data structures. This may be mongo or another 'real' database
1. start doing summaries of trains and look for patterns
1. lots of general data exploration, need to understand the dataset
1. Ways to view, plot, graph, visualize the data. (see below)
1. Start thinking of predicting problems?
